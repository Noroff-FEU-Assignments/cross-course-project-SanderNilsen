    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words

    <p id="web-security-answer">
      Answer: I would start by advising a potential client to familiarize
      themselves with the most common website threats. In this way we can start
      to look at how to minimize the attacks.<br />

      One common threat is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) which involves injecting
      malicious code into trusted websites. To minimize vulnerability to XSS,
      one should ensure that pages on the site that accepts user input, filter
      out code input, such as HTML and JavaScript.<br />

      Another threat is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). While an XSS attack
      exploits the site's trust in external users, CSRF attacks exploit users'
      trust in the site by tricking them into believing that transmitted data
      comes from the site. To limit the attack, you must be careful to log out
      of websites when you are not using them, and to keep accounts separate. A
      good practice is implementation of automatic user timeout.<br />

      We also have SQL injection. An SQL injection is a type of security breach
      where an attacker uses a piece of SQL code to manipulate a database and
      gain access to potentially valuable information. For clients concerned
      about SQL injection, they should: use the latest software versions,
      continuously scan web applications, and use a firewall.<br />

      I would also recommend trusted third-party solutions. This will, for a
      client, help making web security easier to handle. For authentications
      there are solutions like “OneLogin.” And sanitation packages, from NodeJS,
      that examine HTML documents is also something to consider. This can
      protect against XSS attacks.<br />

      Lastly, I would recommend having an SSL certificate. This encrypts links
      between server and browser and is needed for keeping users' information
      private and secure.<br />
