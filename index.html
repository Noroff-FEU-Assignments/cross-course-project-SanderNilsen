    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words

    <p id="web-security-answer">Answer:</p>
    <p>
      I would start by advising a potential client to familiarize themselves
      with the most common website threats. In that way we can start to look at
      how to minimize the attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      One common threat is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) which involves injecting
      malicious code into trusted websites. To minimize vulnerability to XSS, a
      developer should ensure that pages on the website that accepts user input,
      filter out code input, such as HTML and JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another threat is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). While an XSS attack
      exploits the site's trust in external users, CSRF attacks exploit users'
      trust in the site by tricking them into believing that transmitted data
      comes from the site. To limit the attack, you must be careful to log out
      of websites when you are not using them, and to keep accounts separate. A
      good practice is implementation of automatic user timeout.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also have SQL injection. An SQL injection is a type of security breach
      where an attacker uses a piece of SQL code to manipulate a database and
      gain access to potentially valuable information. For clients concerned
      about SQL injection, they should: use the latest software versions,
      continuously scan web applications, and use a firewall.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make web security easier to handle I would also advise the client to
      use trusted third-party solutions. Authentications are more secure with
      frameworks such as OneLogin. And you could use NodeJS for sanitation
      packages that examine HTML documents, which can protect against XSS
      attacks.
